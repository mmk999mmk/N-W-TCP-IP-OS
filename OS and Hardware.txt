Hardware of a system:		
----------------------
Ports
Motherboard
RAM
Hardrive
Registers
RAM vs Hard drive
CPU 32 bit and 64 bit difference of handling and execution of billion of instructions per second.
GPU graphics like in parallelistion it is a specialist
BIOS & UEFI

----------------------
OS:		
----------------------
Kernal and userspace
files and file system and extension
linux file system and naming is case sensitive 
windows and mac are care insensitive
-------------------
Process management:
-------------------
like time slicing
FCFS-First come first serve
SJF-shortest job first
Priority scheduling-giving priority
RRM-robin round method

shared memory and message passing
----------------------------------
Threading:
----------
Multi thread
Dead lock and we should avoid round methods
for the important thing we should be put lock

----------------------------------------------
Memory management:
-------------------
Primary memory and secondary memory.
Contingueous memory allocation:
Fragmentation-internal(with in a block like out of 1 MB we use 0.8 MB) and external(if we have 1024MB we will use 1 and 1024 slots so in the middle are empty)
for this we use paging
Non-Contingueous memory allocation:
logical memory(continuous) and physical memory(main memory will be given some parts)
Paging - swapping and demand paging
Frames
LRU-last recentluy used
LFU-last frequently used
page hit
page fault
--------------
I/O management:
Keyboard
mouse
...

File management:
----------------
Meta data
extensions like.html,.py...
